# Lab 10: Grid Localization using Bayes Filter

## Overview

Since robots do not inherently know where they are located, robot localization is commonly used to determine where they are with respect to their environment. Localization works best when probablilistic methods are used in conjunction with sensors.

To the robot, the world is a continuous 3D space with dimensions x, y, and &theta
