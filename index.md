Hi! My name is Alex Friedman, and I am a MEng student studying mechanical engineering. I am interested in biomechanics and robotics. At Cornell I am a member of SWE Outreach, and I play on the women's club hockey team. As well, I enjoy hiking, reading, and skiing. 

Below you will find an updated account of the work I have done so far this semester in Fast Robots.
