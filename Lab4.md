# Lab 4: Motor Drivers and Open Loop Control

## Prelab

Before soldering my motor drivers, I first drew the following diagram.

## Task 1: Motor Driver with Power Supply and Oscilloscope Hookup

After soldering my motor drivers, I hooked them up to the DC power supply and used the oscilloscope to check the inputs and outputs of the motor driver. Each pin was tested separately. The voltage I used was 3.7 volts because it is the voltage that will be generated by the 850 mAh battery. The setup is shown in the picture below.

I used the following code in order to generate PWM signals. As you can see, I set input 1 (pin 0) to 100, but I set input 2 (pin 1) to 200, double of input 1. The maximum is 255.

The following videos show the signal generated by the input pins as a result of the code above. To the left is the PWM signal for pin 1, and the PWM signal for pin 2 is seen on the right. The oscilloscope settings are the same between the two signals, so it is evident that the duty cycle of pin 1 is half that of pin 2, corresponding to the values given to the pins in the code above.

Then, I checked the signal being generated by the output pins. The signals are shown in the videos below, output 1 on the left, and output 2 on the right.
