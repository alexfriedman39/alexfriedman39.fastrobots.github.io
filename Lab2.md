## Task 1: IMU Setup

First, I connected the IMU to the Artemis board, as shown below, using QWIIC connectors.

In order to interact with the IMU, I installed the “SparkFun 9DOF IMU Breakout_ICM 20948_Arduino Library.” After the library was installed, I ran the Example1_Basics file from the library to get the output shown in the video below. In the script, I kept AD0_VAL defined as 1, because the AD0 pin on the IMU is not connected to the ADR (address) based off the Sparkfun schematic provided. 

BUT WHAT DOES ADO_VAL REPRESENT??
