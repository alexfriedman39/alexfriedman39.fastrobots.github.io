made cases MOVE_ON and MOVE_OFF to turn on flag
while flag on: have the robot move forward while collecting data

sampling time: 10.5 samples per second

averaged maximum speed to get a steady state velocity of around 2661.2145626299675
the closest value I could find for rise time corresponded to 80% rise time
took 0.878 seconds for robot to reach 2140 mm/s
