# Lab 1 

## Lab 1A: The Artemis Board

The purpose of this lab was to become more familiar with programming using Arduino IDE and the Artemis board. 

## Lab 2A: Bluetooth

The purpose of this lab was to test Bluetooth by learning how to use Jupyter lab notebooks in conjunction with the Arduino IDE to communicate with the Artemis board. 

### Task 1: ECHO Command

First, I completed the ECHO function in Arduino IDE. This function can be seen below.

I then called the function in Jupyter, using the code shown below. The command sends the robot "HiHello" and the robot returns "Robot says -> HiHello."
